# Use "led" for LED calibration data processed with raw_single_channel_ana.py

# Use "cosmic" for cosmic ray data processed with raw_cosmic_ana.py
# where the overall reference is the channel you have chosen as ref.

# Reference and comparison channels for studying the possible
# misalignment of the PDS channels.
# The two vectors must either have the same length or you can leave
# reference_channels with a single entry to compare all comparison
# channels against that one reference.
