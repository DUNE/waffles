In src/waffles/np04_analysis/led_calibration/configs/excluded_channels_database.csv: the excluded channels listed for dfb (dfb stands for deviation from baseline, for more information see the deviation_from_baseline parameter of the led_calibration module) equal to 0.3 are optimal, in the sense that the rest of input parameters were tuned so as to exclude the smallest amount of channels possible. The list of excluded channels for a dfb other than 0.3 is arranged by directly adding to the dfb=0.3 excluded-channels list any other channel which resulted in a defective fit. I.e. no fine-tuning effort was done for dfb\neq 0.3 to preserve channels. The reason for this is that the aim of this study (the dfb scan) is not to calibrate the maximum amount of PDS channels, but just to get an estimate of the optimal dfb (optimal from the S/N point of view). To this end, it suffices to have a sufficiently large number of correctly fitted channels for each dfb.
