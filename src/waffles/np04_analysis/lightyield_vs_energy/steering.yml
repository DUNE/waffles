# Step 1. Read np04 pickles files, select beam events, compute the integral, study the charge distribution and then LY vs Energy beam for each channel --> output json files with results

  name: "Analysis1"
  parameters: "params.yml"
  parameters_is_file: True

# Step 2. Read json output file of step one and create the pdf file with plots 
2:
  name: "Analysis2"
  parameters: "params.yml"
  parameters_is_file: True

# Step 3 (Optional). Read json output file of step one and do the analysis for the whole APA (not divided by channels)
