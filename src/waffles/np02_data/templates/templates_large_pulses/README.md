These templates were obtained using the following procedure:
- Selection of LED signals with large amplitude for every channel
- Baseline subtraction
- Cleaning of the persistence plot by applying some cuts (see cuts_used.yaml)
- Computation of the average waveform
- Normalization to the SPE amplitude taken from this file: src/waffles/np02_data/calibration_data/np02-config-v3.0.0.csv
- Plot and save
