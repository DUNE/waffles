class Waveform(WaveformAdcs):

    """
    This class implements a Waveform which includes
    information which is relative to detector readout.
    It inherits from the WaveformAdcs class.

    Attributes
    ----------
    timestamp: int
        The timestamp value for this Waveform
    time_step_ns: float (inherited from WaveformAdcs)
    daq_window_timestamp: int
        The timestamp value for the DAQ window in which
        this Waveform was acquired
    adcs: unidimensional numpy array of integers
    (inherited from WaveformAdcs)
    run_number: int
        Number of the run from which this Waveform was
        acquired
    record_number: int
        Number of the record within which this Waveform
        was acquired
    endpoint: int
        Endpoint number from which this Waveform was
        acquired
    channel: int
        Channel number for this Waveform
    time_offset: int (inherited from WaveformAdcs)
    starting_tick: int
        The iterator value (zero-indexed) for the
        first point of this Waveform, with respect
        to the full acquired waveform. P.e. if this
        Waveform is the result of eliminating the
        first two points of a certain waveform,
        then this attribute equals 2. If no initial
        points have been truncated, then this
        attribute equals 0.
    analyses: OrderedDict of WfAna objects 
    (inherited from WaveformAdcs)
