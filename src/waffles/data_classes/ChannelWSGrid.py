class ChannelWSGrid:

    """
    Stands for Channel Waveform Set Grid. This class 
    implements a set of ChannelWS which are ordered 
    according to some ChannelMap object. 

    Attributes
    ----------
    ChMap : ChannelMap
        A ChannelMap object which is used to physically 
        order the ChannelWS objects
    ChWfSets : dict of dict of ChannelWS
        A dictionary whose keys are endpoint values
        for which there is at least one ChannelWS object
        in this ChannelWSGrid object. The values of such
        dictionary are dictionaries, whose keys are
        channel values for which there is a ChannelWS
        object in this ChannelWSGrid object. The values 
        for the deeper-level dictionaries are ChannelWS 
        objects. Note that there might be a certain
        UniqueChannel object which is present in the
        ChannelMap, but for which there is no ChannelWS
        object in this attribute (ChWfSets). I.e.
        appearance of a certain UniqueChannel object
        in the ChannelMap does not guarantee that there
        will be a ChannelWS object in this attribute
        which comes from such unique channel. Hence, 
        one should always handle a KeyError exceptions
        when trying to subscribe ChWfSets with the endpoint
        and channel coming from an UniqueChannel object
        within the ChMap attribute.

        compute_calib_histo : bool
            If True, then the calibration histogram for each

        This method returns a plotly.graph_objects.Figure 
        with a grid of subplots which are arranged according
        to the self.__ch_map attribute. The subplot at position
        i,j may be empty if there is no ChannelWS object in
        self.__ch_wf_sets which matches the UniqueChannel object
        at position i,j in the self.__ch_map attribute. If it
        is not empty, a subplot may contain a waveform
        representation (either overlayed, averaged or heatmapped),
        or a calibration histogram. The type of representation
        is determined by the 'mode' parameter.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *args
            These arguments only make a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'average' and the
            'analysis_label' parameter is not None. In such
            case, these are the positional arguments handled 
            to the WaveformAdcs.analyse() instance method of 
            the computed mean waveform. I.e. for the mean 
            waveform wf, the call to its analyse() method
            is wf.analyse(analysis_label, *args, **kwargs).
            The WaveformAdcs.analyse() method does not 
            perform any well-formedness checks, so it is 
            the caller's responsibility to ensure so for 
            these parameters.
        figure : plotly.graph_objects.Figure
            If it is not None, then it must have been
            generated using plotly.subplots.make_subplots()
            with a 'rows' and 'cols' parameters matching
            the Rows and Columns attribute of self.__ch_map.
            If that's the case, then this method adds the
            plots to this figure and eventually returns 
            it. If it is None, then this method generates
            a new figure and returns it.
        share_x_scale (resp. share_y_scale) : bool
            If True, the x-axis (resp. y-axis) scale will be 
            shared among all the subplots.
        mode : str
            This parameter should be set to 'overlay', 
            'average', 'heatmap' or 'calibration'. If any
            other input is given, an exception will be raised. 
                The default setting is 'overlay', which means 
            that all of the considered waveforms, up to the 
            'wfs_per_axes' parameter, will be plotted. 
                If it set to 'average', instead of plotting 
            every considered waveform, only the averaged 
            waveform of the considered waveforms will be plotted. 
                If it is set to 'heatmap', then a 2D-histogram, 
            whose entries are the union of all of the points 
            of every considered waveform, will be plotted. In 
            the 'heatmap' mode, the baseline of each waveform 
            is subtracted from each waveform before plotting. 
            Note that to perform such a correction, the waveforms 
            should have been previously analysed, so that at 
            least one baseline value is available. The analysis 
            which gave the baseline value which should be used 
            is specified via the 'analysis_label' parameter. 
            Check its documentation for more information.
                If it is set to 'calibration', then the
            calibration histogram of each ChannelWS object
            will be plotted. In this case, the CalibHisto
            attribute of each ChannelWS object must be
            defined, i.e. it must be different to None.
            If it is not, then an exception will be raised.
        wfs_per_axes : int
            If it is None, then every waveform in each
            ChannelWS object will be considered. Otherwise,
            only the first wfs_per_axes waveforms of each
            ChannelWS object will be considered. If 
            wfs_per_axes is greater than the number of 
            waveforms in a certain ChannelWS object, then 
            all of its waveforms will be considered.
        analysis_label : str
            The meaning of this parameter varies slightly
            depending on the value given to the 'mode'
            parameter. 
                If mode is set to 'overlay', then this 
            parameter is optional and it only makes a 
            difference if the 'plot_analysis_markers' 
            parameter is set to True. In such case, this 
            parameter is given to the 'analysis_label'
            parameter of the Waveform.plot() (actually 
            WaveformAdcs.plot()) method for each WaveformAdcs 
            object(s) which will be plotted. This parameter 
            gives the key for the WfAna object within the 
            Analyses attribute of each plotted waveform from 
            where to take the information for the analysis 
            markers plot. In this case, if 'analysis_label' 
            is None, then the last analysis added to 
            the Analyses attribute will be the used one. 
                If mode is set to 'average' and this 
            parameter is defined, then this method will 
            analyse the newly computed average waveform, 
            say wf, by calling 
            wf.analyse(analysis_label, *args, **kwargs).
            Additionally, if the 'plot_analysis_markers'
            parameter is set to True and this parameter
            is defined, then this parameter is given to 
            the 'analysis_label' parameter of the wf.plot() 
            method, i.e. the analysis markers for the 
            plotted average waveform are those of the 
            newly computed analysis. This parameter gives 
            the key for the WfAna object within the 
            Analyses attribute of the average waveform 
            where to take the information for the analysis 
            markers plot.
                If 'mode' is set to 'heatmap', this 
            parameter is not optional, i.e. it must be 
            defined, and gives the analysis whose baseline 
            will be subtracted from each waveform before 
            plotting. In this case, it will not be checked 
            that, for each waveform, the analysis with the 
            given label is available. It is the caller's 
            responsibility to ensure so.
                If 'mode' is set to 'calibration', then
            this parameter is not used.
        plot_analysis_markers : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average'.
                If mode is set to 'overlay', then this 
            parameter is given to the 
            'plot_analysis_markers' argument of the 
            WaveformAdcs.plot() method for each waveform in 
            which will be plotted. 
                If mode is set to 'average' and the
            'analysis_label' parameter is defined, then this
            parameter is given to the 'plot_analysis_markers'
            argument of the WaveformAdcs.plot() method for
            the newly computed average waveform. If the
            'analysis_label' parameter is not defined, then
            this parameter will be automatically interpreted
            as False.
                In both cases, if True, analysis markers 
            for the plotted WaveformAdcs objects will 
            potentially be plotted together with each 
            waveform. For more information, check the 
            'plot_analysis_markers' parameter documentation 
            in the WaveformAdcs.plot() method. If False, no 
            analysis markers will be plot.
        show_baseline_limits : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is set 
            to True. In that case, this parameter means 
            whether to plot vertical lines framing the 
            intervals which were used to compute the baseline.
        show_baseline : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is set 
            to True. In that case, this parameter means whether 
            to plot an horizontal line matching the computed 
            baseline.
        show_general_integration_limits : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is set 
            to True. In that case, this parameter means whether 
            to plot vertical lines framing the general 
            integration interval.
        show_general_amplitude_limits : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is 
            set to True. In that case, this parameter means 
            whether to plot vertical lines framing the general 
            amplitude interval.
        show_spotted_peaks : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is set 
            to True. In that case, this parameter means whether 
            to plot a triangle marker over each spotted peak.
        show_peaks_integration_limits : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'overlay' or 'average',
            and the 'plot_analysis_markers' parameter is set 
            to True. In that case, this parameter means whether 
            to plot two vertical lines framing the integration 
            interval for each spotted peak.
        time_bins (resp. adc_bins) : int
            This parameter only makes a difference if the 'mode'
            parameter is set to 'heatmap'. In that case, it is
            the number of bins along the horizontal (resp. 
            vertical) axis, i.e. the time (resp. ADCs) axis.
        time_range_lower_limit (resp. time_range_upper_limit) : int
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'heatmap'. In such case,
            it gives the inclusive lower (resp. upper) limit of 
            the time range, in time ticks, which will be considered 
            for the heatmap plot. If it is not defined, then it 
            is assumed to be 0 (resp. self.PointsPerWf - 1).
            It must be smaller (resp. greater) than
            time_range_upper_limit (resp. time_range_lower_limit).
        adc_range_above_baseline (resp. adc_range_below_baseline) : int
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'heatmap'. In that case,
            its absolute value times one (resp. minus one) is 
            the upper (resp. lower) limit of the ADCs range 
            which will be considered for the heatmap plot. 
            Note that, in this case, each waveform is 
            corrected by its own baseline.
        plot_peaks_fits : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'calibration'. In that
            case, then for the calibration histogram of each 
            subplot, this parameter is given to the 'plot_fits' 
            parameter of the CalibrationHistogram.plot() method.
            It means whether to plot the fits of the peaks, if
            available, over the histogram.
        detailed_label : bool
            This parameter only makes a difference if
            the 'mode' parameter is set to 'average' or
            'heatmap', respectively. If the 'mode' parameter
            is set to 'average', then this parameter means
            whether to show the iterator values of the two
            first available waveforms (which were used to
            compute the mean waveform) in the label of the
            mean waveform plot. If the 'mode' parameter is 
            set to 'heatmap', then this parameter means 
            whether to show the iterator values of the two 
            first available waveforms (which were used to 
            compute the 2D-histogram) in the top annotation 
            of each subplot.
        **kwargs
            These arguments only make a difference if the
            'mode' parameter is set to 'average' and the
            'analysis_label' parameter is not None. In such
            case, these are the keyword arguments handled 
            to the WaveformAdcs.analyse() instance method of 
            the computed mean waveform. I.e. for the mean 
            waveform wf, the call to its analyse() method
            is wf.analyse(analysis_label, *args, **kwargs).
            The WaveformAdcs.analyse() method does not 
            perform any well-formedness checks, so it is 
            the caller's responsibility to ensure so for 
            these parameters.

        This method is not intended for user usage. It is
        meant to be called uniquely by the ChannelWSGrid.plot() 
        method, where the well-formedness of the input 
        figure has been checked. This method adds annotations 
        on top of each subplot of the given figure. The 
        annotations are the string representation of the
        UniqueChannel object, each of which is placed
        on top of a subplot according to its position in
        the self.__ch_map attribute.

        Parameters
        ----------
        figure : plotly.graph_objects.Figure
            The figure to which the annotations will be added
        also_add_run_info : bool
            If True, then for each subplot for which there
            is a ChannelWS object, say chws, present in the 
            self.__ch_wf_sets attribute, the first run number 
            which appears in the chws.Runs attribute will be
            additionally added to the annotation. For each
            subplot for which there is no ChannelWS object,
            according to the physical position given by the
            self.__ch_map attribute, no additional annotation
            will be added.

        Returns
        ----------
        figure : plotly.graph_objects.Figure
            The given figure with the annotations added

        This method calls the fit_peaks() method of 
        each CalibrationHistogram object in the
        ChannelWS objects contained in self.__ch_wf_sets
        whose channel is present in the self.__ch_map
        attribute. It returns False if at least one 
        of the fit_peaks() calls returns False, and 
        True if every fit_peaks() call returned True.
        I.e. it returns True if max_peaks peaks were
        successfully found for each histogram, and
        False if only n peaks were found for at
        least one of the histograms, where n < max_peaks.

        Parameters
        ----------
        max_peaks : int
            The maximum number of peaks which will be
            searched for in each calibration histogram.
            It is given to the 'max_peaks' parameter of
            the CalibrationHistogram.fit_peaks() method
            for each calibration histogram.
        prominence : float
            It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 
            1.0. It gives the minimal prominence of the 
            peaks to spot. This parameter is passed to the 
            'prominence' parameter of the 
            CalibrationHistogram.fit_peaks() method for 
            each calibration histogram. For more information, 
            check the documentation of such method.
        half_points_to_fit : int
            It must be a positive integer. For each peak in
            each calibration histogram, it gives the number 
            of points to consider on either side of the peak 
            maximum, to fit each gaussian function. It is
            given to the 'half_points_to_fit' parameter of
            the CalibrationHistogram.fit_peaks() method for
            each calibration histogram. For more information, 
            check the documentation of such method.
        initial_percentage : float
            It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0.
            This parameter is passed to the 'initial_percentage' 
            parameter of the CalibrationHistogram.fit_peaks()
            method for each calibration histogram. For more 
            information, check the documentation of such method.
        percentage_step : float
            It must be greater than 0.0 and smaller than 1.0.
            This parameter is passed to the 'percentage_step'
            parameter of the CalibrationHistogram.fit_peaks()
            method for each calibration histogram. For more 
            information, check the documentation of such method.

        Returns
