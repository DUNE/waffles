    Stands for Waveform Analysis Result. This class
    inherits from the ORDict class, and it is intended
    to store the results of an analysis (i.e. a class
    which derives from WfAna) which has been performed
    over a certain waveform. It adds nothing to ORDict,
    i.e. it is just a renaming of ORDict
