        This method creates an object of type analysis_class,

            implementation of such method is enforced by the

            responsibility to ensure that such method takes, 
            indeed, a WaveformAdcs object as its first argument.
        input_parameters : IPDict
            The input parameters which will be passed to the
            analysis_class initializer. It is the user's
            responsibility to ensure that input_parameters
            contain the required information to initialize
            the analysis_class object, and that it is 
            well-defined.
        *args
            Additional positional arguments which are given 
            to the analyse() method of analysis_class
        overwrite : bool
            If True, the method will overwrite any existing
            WfAna (or derived) object with the same label 
            (key) within self.__analyses.
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments which are given 
            to the analyse() method of analysis_class
        
        N.B.: It is preferred to keep track of all of the I/O 
        information of the analysis in the WfAna attributes which 
        are designed for that purpose, i.e. WfAna.InputParameters 
        and WfAna.Result. However, *args and **kwargs are enabled

        analyse() method of WfAna (or derived) with parameters that 
        have no interest from the point of view of the analysis.
