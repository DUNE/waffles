    Attributes
    ----------
    TimeStep_ns : float
        The time step (in nanoseconds) for this waveform
    Adcs : unidimensional numpy array of integers
        The readout for this waveform, in # of ADCs
    TimeOffset : int
        A time offset, in units of TimeStep_ns (i.e.
        time ticks) which will be used as a relative
        alignment among different waveform_adcs
        objects for plotting and analysis purposes.
        It must be semipositive and smaller than
        len(self.__adcs)-1. It is set to 0 by default.

    Methods

        This method creates an object of type analysis_class,

        wf_ana class. Then, runs its analyse() method on the
        self waveform_adcs object. The created analysis object
        is stored in the self.__analyses attribute, using the
        label parameter as its key. This method returns the
        output of the called method, even if it is None.

        Parameters
        ----------
        label : str
            Key for the new wf_ana (or derived) object within
            the self.__analyses OrderedDict
        analysis_class : type
            Class (type) which must inherit from wf_ana. For
            efficiency reasons, this check is not performed
            at this level (waveform_adcs). The given class
            must have an analyse() method which takes a
            waveform_adcs object as its first argument. The
            implementation of such method is enforced by the
            wf_ana abstract class, but it is the user's
            responsibility to ensure that such method takes,
            indeed, a waveform_adcs object as its first argument.
        input_parameters : ip_dict
            The input parameters which will be passed to the
            analysis_class initializer. It is the user's
            responsibility to ensure that input_parameters
            contain the required information to initialize
            the analysis_class object, and that it is
            well-defined.
        *args
            Additional positional arguments which are given
            to the analyse() method of analysis_class
        overwrite : bool
            If True, the method will overwrite any existing
            wf_ana (or derived) object with the same label
            (key) within self.__analyses.
        **kwargs
            Additional keyword arguments which are given
            to the analyse() method of analysis_class

        N.B.: It is preferred to keep track of all of the I/O
        information of the analysis in the wf_ana attributes which
        are designed for that purpose, i.e. wf_ana.InputParameters
        and wf_ana.Result. However, *args and **kwargs are enabled
        to give more room for the user to potentially configure the
        analyse() method of wf_ana (or derived) with parameters that
        have no interest from the point of view of the analysis.

        and returned by this method, even if it is None.
