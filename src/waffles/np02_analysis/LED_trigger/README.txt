The single AnalysisN.py with N>1 can be used alone.
The various AnalysisN were created to keep memory of different runs associated to different channels, so check the run number and the channel that is already in the code, for correct usage.


Analysis1.py has the Waffles analysis structure and should be used together with the other usual waffles files.
The waffles analysis is not yet ready to be used: need to write the utils.py and to complete the Analysis1.py
